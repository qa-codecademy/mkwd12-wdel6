# 🕸️ Welcome to "HTTP: How To Party" Server 🎉

## What is this madness?
Congratulations! You're invited to make the world's most unnecessary C# web server. We've boldly reimplemented HTTP from scratch, because why use battle-tested libraries when you can roll your own bugs?

## Features
- Serves web pages... sometimes
- Implements HTTP/1.1... mostly
- Written in C#... definitely

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Build the project
3. Run the server while praying to the TCP/IP gods
4. Marvel at your creation

## FAQ
Q: Why did you make this?
A: Because sleep is overrated and sanity is optional.

Q: Is it production-ready?
A: If by "production" you mean "showing off to your cat," then absolutely!

Q: Can I contribute?
A: Sure! The more hands on this keyboard, the more entertaining the bugs become.

## Disclaimer
This server is about as stable as a jenga tower in an earthquake. Use at your own risk. Side effects may include hair loss, uncontrollable laughter, and a newfound appreciation for established web frameworks.

Remember: When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make a web server that can handle citrus-related requests.

Happy serving! 🚀
